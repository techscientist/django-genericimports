Why
---

Mainly because i was ******* ***** ****** tired of doing import scripts for all the projects that I worked on, the second reason is that it doesn't seem to be any open source truly generic importer that does the job right, so I felt it was necessary to do it. Of course there are really cool import applications out there, and maybe they suit you better than this one. This importer was born to satisfy the need to import 400k+ records files not only from us, but foor thirdparties as well that don't get the sanitization really well using a quite complex set of related models with multiple behaviours.

I know it's not the best approach, an it is slow as hell, but that is why I opensourced it, so everyone could improve  it. By the way I'm quite a fan of commenting the code, so you will find tons of comments in it, even some comments that are obviously obvious, but hey, not only 10+ y/exp programmers will be looking at this.

Please note that this application was made to cover all use cases and it sanitizes the data. It's not meant to be fast, at least at this stage of development. Feel free to send your optimization patches.
